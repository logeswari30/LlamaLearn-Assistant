## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**
   - Ensure your Groq API key is valid and properly set
   - Check API rate limits and quotas

2. **PDF Upload Issues**
   - Verify PDF is not password-protected
   - Ensure PDF contains extractable text (not scanned images)

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts

4. **Port Already in Use**
   - Use a different port: `streamlit run enhanced_aitutor1.py --server.port 8502`

### Debug Mode
Add `--logger.level=debug` to the streamlit command for verbose logging:
```bash
streamlit run enhanced_aitutor1.py --logger.level=debug
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **User Data**: Implement proper data encryption for production use
- **Authentication**: Consider implementing OAuth or JWT for enhanced security
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
